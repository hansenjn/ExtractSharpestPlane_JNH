# ExtractSharpestPlane_JNH
## General description
ExtractSharpestPlane_JNH is an ImageJ/FIJI plugin to extract the sharpest plane by highest SD from image stacks. The plugin can make use of the BioFormats integration in FIJI. Thus, it is highly recommended to use it with FIJI.

The plugin has been originally developed to be included in high-throughput analysis of images acquired with a Zeiss Cell Discoverer (CD7). Here, the plugin can be used to automatically extract images from .czi files and extract the sharpest plane from each image stack. This works better than performing the same with the integration in the CD7 software, as with this plugin the sharpest plane is detected for each image individually and does not need to be specified for all images together. Thus, the plugin delivers the sharpest possible images for each image stack.
